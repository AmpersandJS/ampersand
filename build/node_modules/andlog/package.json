  "readme": "# &log\n\nSuper simple, but solves these pain points:\n\n- Lets you leave log statements in production, client-side code.\n- It won't log anything unless `localStorage.debug` is set.\n- Uses native `console` rather than trying to wrap it in something (which makes the output ugly).\n- Works with CommonJS.\n- It's just a selective alias for the `window.console` so the normal API applies.\n\n## How to use it:\n\n\nStep 1. include it:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"andlog.js\"></script>\n```\n\nStep 2. Use the `console` in your code as usual:\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(\"hello\");\n```\n\nStep 3. If you want to see log output set a value called `debug` in `localStorage` by doing typing this in console:\n\n```javascript\nlocalStorage.debug = true\n```\n\nStep 4. Refresh the page, you should now see logs.\n\nStep 5. To turn off console, just delete the localStorage flag:\n\n```javascript\ndelete localStorage.debug\n```\n\nStep 6. Feel free to deploy to production with console stuff in there.\n\n\n## CommonJS Version\n\nIf you're using this on the client but your project is in node.js you can install this with: [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/) and npm. \n\n```javascript\nvar logger = require('andlog');\n\nlogger.log('hello');\n```\n\nThis is identical to:\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log('hello');\n```\n\nYou *could* even get fancy and call it `console`. However by doing this you take the risk that you'll forget to `require` it and it'll still work and you'll ship it to production. However, obviously this would work as well:\n\n```javascript\nvar console = require('andlog');\n\nconsole.log('hello');\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\nIf you like this, follow [@HenrikJoreteg](http://twitter.com/henrikjoreteg) on the twitterwebz.\n",
