## How to contribute to Backbone.js

* Before you open a ticket or send a pull request,
[search](https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/issues) for previous
discussions about the same feature or issue. Add to the earlier ticket if you
find one.

* Before sending a pull request for a feature or bug fix, be sure to have
[tests](http://backbonejs.org/test/test.html).

* Use the same coding style as the rest of the
[codebase](https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js).

* In your pull request, do not add documentation or rebuild the minified
`backbone-min.js` file. We'll do that before cutting a new release.

* All pull requests should be made to the `master` branch.
