# Browser altenatives to built-in node.js modules

This is used by `browserify` module. Initially these files were in `node-browser-resolve`
but [disappeared in v1.0.1](https://github.com/shtylman/node-browser-resolve/commit/2799bcc316052a53fdafecd39576e14673a47ab0) which broke `browserify` dependency. This module is that missing
dependency.

**Would love to get test contributions**
